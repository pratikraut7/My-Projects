## 📁 Project 1: Fake News Detection using NLP  
*(Inside Folder)*

**Folder:** `Fake-News-Detection/`

### Description  
This project focuses on detecting whether a news article is **Fake or Real** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

### Key Concepts Used
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer
- Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes)
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

### Dataset  
Large CSV dataset of news articles.  
Uploaded using **Git LFS** due to size limitations.

### Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK
